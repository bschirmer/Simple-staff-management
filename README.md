# Simple Staff login using Ruby on Rails
This is a simple staff login app using Ruby on Rails. It was written to explore Ruby on Rails as I haven't touched it before. I have used Laravel for web development and Ruby on Rails seemed similar so I tried this simple app.

## How to run
NOTE: you will need rails installed to run this
Clone the repo
Navigate to the repo in terminal
run `rails db:migrate` to set up the database
run `rails server` to start the server
Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser
From here you can add a new user and play around

## NOTE
This is very simple and could use a lot of work. I wasn't really going for pretty, I was just dipping my toes in Ruby on Rails
